# Real-World-Large-Language-Models
 This repository leverages the power of LangChain, an open-source programming language development platform.

## Common Knowledge

- Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational machine learning models that use deep learning algorithms to process and understand natural language.
- Llama 2 is Meta's open source large language model (LLM). It's basically the Facebook parent company's response to OpenAI's GPT models and Google's AI models like PaLM 2â€”but with one key difference: it's freely available for almost anyone to use for research and commercial purposes.

- The Llama 2 is a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned generative text models, ranging from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters, designed for dialogue use cases.

- It outperforms open-source chat models on most benchmarks and is on par with popular closed-source models in human evaluations for helpfulness and safety.

- LangChain is an open source framework that lets software developers working with artificial intelligence (AI) and its machine learning subset combine large language models with other external components to develop LLM-powered applications.

    Its objective is to run the LLaMA model with 4-bit integer quantization on MacBook. It is a plain C/C++ implementation optimized for Apple silicon and x86 architectures, supporting various integer quantization and BLAS libraries. Originally a web chat example, it now serves as a development playground for ggml library features.

- GGML
    A C library for machine learning, facilitates the distribution of large language models (LLMs). It utilizes quantization to enable efficient LLM execution on consumer hardware. GGML files contain binary-encoded data, including version number, hyperparameters, vocabulary, and weights. The vocabulary comprises tokens for language generation, while the weights determine the LLM's size. Quantization reduces precision to optimize resource usage.

## Quantized Models from the Hugging Face Community
- The Hugging Face community provides quantized models, which allow us to efficiently and effectively utilize the model on the T4 GPU. It is important to consult reliable sources before using any model.

- There are several variations available, but the ones that interest us are based on the GGLM library.

- We can see the different variations that [Llama-2-13B-GGML](https://huggingface.co/models?search=llama%202%20ggml) has here.

- In this case, we will use the model called [Llama-2-13B-chat-GGML](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-chat-GGML).
